  <h2>In Ideological Relationship</h2>
  <p>The ideological relationships are founded on conscious values and beliefs about how humans should relate to physical places. The defining characteristic of ideological relationships is a well-articulated ideology about how to live in a place. "Urban City" is my ideological place to reflect my cultural background.</p>

 <h2>In Spiritual Relationship</h2>        
   <p>Spiritual relationship is feeling a sense of belonging which seem to be more of an intuitive connection than an emotional, cognitive, or material connection. The aspect of relationships to places based on something much less tangible than personal history. Knowledge is the primary value that what I focus on my life. "Libary" can be the spiritual place that reflects how I live.</p>
