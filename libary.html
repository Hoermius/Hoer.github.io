<h1> Library.</h1>
<p class="part01text"> 
Library, a collection of books or other written or printed materials, as well as the facility in which they are housed and the institution that is responsible for their maintenance. This page is my exploration of the spiritual relationship in "Libary" by using context of mythology and hero in order to introduce my favorite genre and books.

            <h3>The Modern Library</h3>
    
<p> Modern libraries, in addition to providing patrons with access to books and other materials, often publish lists of accessions and may maintain a readers' advisory service. Interlibrary loan services, lecture series, public book reviews, and the maintenance of special juvenile collections are other important recent developments. 
            
            Three systems of book classification are widely used to facilitate access to library collections: the Dewey decimal system of Melvil Dewey, the system of Charles Ammi Cutter, and the Library of Congress system (see catalog). Since the 1930s libraries have had several technological tools at their disposal, including microphotographic techniques for copying, computer data banks enabling the storage of far more information and the search of indexes and catalogs far more quickly than ever before, and computer networks that provide instant access to materials in libraries throughout the world and to the Internet and its increasingly rich resources.

            <h3>Different Types of Books</h3>
            <p>There are different types of books that fall into these different categories. For instance, a fictional book that involves science with action is generally refereed to as science fiction book or thriller. Pure fictions are generally those books that are made up, but some of the elements of these books are generally made of truths or real facts, and thee elements are elaborated in such a manner, so that a completely new story can be created. Non-fiction books contain factual information, such as biographies and history books. Biographies are examples of nonfiction works. Most biographies are nonfiction, but not all nonfiction works are biographies by any means. We say "most" biographies, because a biography of a fictional character is really a fictional book.

            <h3>The Original Function of Myth</h3>
            <p>The original function of the myth is explained by natural law based on the knowledge from the century. Our ancestors always doubt and consider what the origin of the universe is. They couldn’t solve natural law that we can answer today. Every mythology answers how the universe was created from “empty space.” In Greek and Roman mythology, it explained that as the world was filled with darkness and emptiness which called chaos. The daughter of chaos, Gaea first emerged at the creation and she was the great mother. Gaea rebelled against her husband Ouranos, and he abandoned her sons in the Tartaros. Kronos took over the power from Ouranos by castration. Ancient civilization deified abstract ideology by answering the origin of the universe. Kronos is the goddesses of the time. Time is a really important element from the mythology that divided past, present and future. Gaea and Ouranos are nature goddesses that order created the first natural law, then time created the second natural law which called “law of cause and effect” and it gave convenience to our ancestors.</p>

             <h3>Archetypal Myths</h3>
           <p>Archetypal myths explain the nature of the world and life. Thus, many peoples have tales to explain the origins of places and objects: the city, the mountain, the temple, the tree and even the stone. Other archetypal myths serve to instruct. For example, the quest archetype is typically a journey where the hero or heroine must overcome their own faults and weaknesses in order to reemerge as a mature, productive member of their society. <br> <br>

While some aspects of these myths have remarkable similarities across cultures, others have peculiarities specific to that land. Sometimes it is possible to trace the inheritance of a part of a myth as it is passed from culture to culture. Here we look at four types of myths and how they show up in cultures across the world.</p>

      <div class="column">
           <h3>Creation and Non-Creation Myth</h3>
            <p> Glesier distils the range of our response to the cosmos and time into two distinct forms of time: creation myth and non-creation myth. Creation myth answer, how the universe was created from chaos and time began. Non- creation myths imagine a universe without a beginning and it also imagines time eithers as a straight line extending infinitely in both directions or as a circle.</p>

<h2>The Hero</h2>                
<div id="mainContent">
        <div class="column">
            <h3>Hero's Journey</h3>
            <p>According to Joseph Campbell in the Hero with a Thousand Faces, “a hero is any male or
female who leaves the world of his or her everyday life to undergo a journey to a special
world where challenges and fears are overcome in order to secure a quest, which is then
shared with other members of the hero’s community.” 
The development of the hero has changed with time. In its earliest form, heroes were
associated with religion or god-directed. Later they were more secular or military as seen
in Beowulf. Then with realism, they were realistic representations of their society.
Today, many are anti-heroes. There are subdivision of the classic or epic hero such as epic hero, tragic hero, gothic
hero or romantic hero that developed overtime.</p>

        <div class="column">
             <h3>Characteristics of the Epic Hero</h3>
            <ul  class="item01">
  <li>His/her mother is a royal virgin and his/her father is king.</li>
  <li>The circumstances of his conception are unusual.</li>  
  <li>He/she is reputed to be the son of a god.</li>  
  <li>At birth an attempt is made, often by his/her father, to kill him/her, but he is spirited away and reared by foster parents in a far country</li>
  <li>Is victorious over a king and /or a giant, dragon, or wild beat.</li>
  <li>Marries a princess/prince and becomes king and for a time reigns uneventfully.</li>
  <li>Is driven from the throne and city and meets with a mysterious death.</li>
  <li>The hero is naïve and inexperienced.</li>
  <li>The hero goes through a rite of passage or initiation.</li>
  <li>The hero engages in test or contests of strength.</li>
  <li>The hero suffers a wound, sometimes emotional or spiritual from which the hero
never completely recovers.</li>
</ul>  
        </div>
      <div class="column">
            <h3>Hero and Fate</h3>
            <p>The Greek tragedy does not depend upon the conflict between fate and human will, but upon the peculiar nature of the material by which this conflict is revealed. I found great irony in the fact that individuals might seal their fate by the very precautions they took to prevent it. Can heroes survive the tragedy of fate if they do not action? As  the song  called "Something Just Like This":

          <i>
I've been reading books of old <br>
The legends and the myths <br>
Achilles and his gold <br>
Hercules and his gifts <br>
Spiderman's control <br>
And Batman with his fists <br>
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list <br>
          </i>
        <p>I not looking for superhuman gifts but I admire a wise and virtuous hero.</p>
