<h1> Urban City.</h1>
<p class="part01text"> 
The name city is given to certain urban communities by virtue of some legal or conventional distinction that can vary between regions or nations. In most cases, however, the concept of city refers to a particular type of community, the urban community, and its culture, known as “urbanism.”  <br> <br>
Research on urbanism naturally focuses on their defining institution, the city, and the lifeways, or cultural forms, that grow up within cities. Urban scholarship has steadily progressed toward a conception of cities and urban cultures that is free of ethnocentrism, with broad cross-cultural and historical validity. This page is my exploration of  the ideological relationship in Urban city by using context of T.S Eliot, "Unreal city", scrap of visual ethnography and terms of sociology in order to reflect my cultural background.

            <h3>Context from <i>The Waste Land,</i> by T.S Eliot.</h3>
            <p> [...] <br>
                Unreal City, <br>
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, <br>
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, <br>
I had not thought death had undone so many. <br>
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, <br>
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet. <br>
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street, <br>
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours <br>
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine. <br>
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: “Stetson! <br>
“You who were with me in the ships at Mylae! <br>
“That corpse you planted last year in your garden, <br>
“Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? <br>
“Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? <br>
“Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men, <br>
“Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again! <br>
“You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!” <br>

            <h3>Interpretation</h3>
            <p>  Eliot utilizes the “Unreal city”, London, as the main setting for “The Wasteland”. The city comes to embody the title of the poem, being portrayed as ugly, cruel and grey, lacking any real human warmth or meaningful connections. For Eliot, the city is both personal and specific, as he describes its geographical features and notes many of its streets and landmarks. However, London is also presented as being emblematic; it is a center, of sorts, in the way many great capitals of past empires have been centers (economic, cultural, etc). Eliot seems to waver between these views of the Unreal city, unable to reconcile his clear admiration for London as one of the quintessential focal points for the modern world, and his fear that the modern city will alienate its inhabitants from each other and the world, rising and falling like its great-city predecessors of the past. </p>

      <div class="column">
            <p> Eliot's "The Wasteland" concentrates on the depression and despair of life as part of death. It is his description and characterization of "unreal city" and images of the city life that supports his subject that city life is dirty, overcrowded and malicious. "Under brown fog", "like a taxi throbbing waiting", "crowd flowed over London Bridge" are images he illustrates of what he wants the reader to focus on. Interestingly, Eliot also uses contrasting ideas to the city life: prison compared to palace. Palace being the most luxurious living life, to a prison being the most depressing (and punishable) living life. Furthermore, Eliot mentions "London Bridge" and "the Hanged Man". London has a history as being a great, wealthy and powerful empire for hundreds of years. But, London also has a dark history of crime and punishment - and the London bridge structure is a symbol to that piece of history. In the Elizabethian era, people who committed crimes were mutilated and had their heads chopped off, and then their heads were placed on stakes above London Bridge to warn everyone of what happens to them if they commit a crime. Eliot's description of "crowd flowed over London Bridge" is an imagery that it is not only the living that crowds the London Bridge, but the spirits of the hundred of people who died decades ago. The "Unreal City" is Eliot's description that millions and millions of souls crowd the city. Could it be his point that it is useless to determine the living with the unliving in a cruel and depressing city? </p>

<h2>Aspect of Society and Culture</h2>

            <h3>Material Engagement Change As Society</h3>
            <p>Agriculture became subservient to the demands of the city, and worked within the city because it was subservient to the demands of specialization. These changes in consciousness created by the urban revolution moved material engagement to a higher level. People began to think in high standard symbols. The culture grew more complicated. Thus began the development of written language and records. As a result, writing was the most critical invention of the urban revolution.</p>

        <div class="column">
             <h3>Rapid Social Changes</h3>
            <p> People started to codify the passage of time when technology rapidly advanced in the culture. Compared to earlier eras, the speed of these radical changes swept through the population, and has led scholars to call it the Big Bang of consciousness.</p>

      <div class="column">
            <h3>The Big Bang of Consciousness</h3>
            <p>  Archeologist Steven Mithen has questioned about the Big bang of consciousness. He sees the ability to move information between modules as the innovation that led to the modern mind and important capacity for culturally invented time.  </p>
